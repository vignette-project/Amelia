Amelia is a BuildStream project. Before you make any changes, you must first tell Buildstream to track new changes on the project.

so first things first is to copy everything to a working directory to build these projects. eg (cp -vRf $PWD work/) Then run this:

bst track --deps all core.bst \
                 vm/image.bst 
                 boards/pinebook-pro/image.bst \
                 boards/rock64/image.bst \
                 boards/raspberrypi-4/image.bst \
                 vm/repo-devel.bst \
                 iso/image.bst

Once that's done, you have five targets to pick:

boards/raspberrypi-4/image.bst
boards/rock64/image.bst
boards/pinebook-pro/image.bst
vm/image.bst
iso/image.bst 

To build a specific target just use bst build $TARGET.
